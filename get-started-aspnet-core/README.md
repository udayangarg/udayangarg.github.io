# ASP.NET Core getting started application

The [Getting started tutorial for ASP.NET Core](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/runtimes/dotnet/getting-started.html#getting_started) uses this sample application to provide you with a sample workflow for working with any .NET Core app on IBM Cloud. In the workflow, you set up a development environment, deploy an app locally and on IBM Cloud, and integrate a IBM Cloud database service in your app. For detailed instructions, see the tutorial.

The ASP.NET Core getting started application uses a [Cloudant service](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudant) from IBM Cloud to add information to a database and then return information from the database to the application UI.

The user enters the name, Mary and the screen refreshes to display, Hello, Mary, I've added you to the database. The database contents listed are now Mary, Joe, Jane, and Bob.">
